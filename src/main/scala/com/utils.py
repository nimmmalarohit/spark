I'll help you create a comprehensive EPIC description and acceptance criteria for enhancing your GCP chatbot. Based on your project files and requirements, here's what I'd recommend:

## EPIC: GCP Chatbot Enhancement - Intent Intelligence and Knowledge Base Integration

### Description:
Our current GCP chatbot serves as a documentation reference tool that matches user intents to predefined wiki links. This EPIC aims to transform the chatbot into a more intelligent assistant by:

1. Creating a flexible intent onboarding framework to easily add new capabilities
2. Developing a wiki crawler to build a comprehensive knowledge base for more contextual responses
3. Implementing advanced analytics to track chat lifecycle metrics and measure resolution success rates

This enhancement will reduce the need for manual documentation updates, improve response accuracy, and provide valuable insights into user interactions and bot performance.

### Background:
The current implementation uses a rule-based approach with predefined intents that simply return static wiki links when matched. Users must navigate through these links to find answers rather than receiving direct responses. We lack visibility into chat success rates and the ability to efficiently expand the bot's knowledge.

### Acceptance Criteria:

#### 1. Dynamic Intent Onboarding System
- Create a structured JSON schema for defining new intents with minimal code changes
- Implement an admin interface for non-technical users to add new intents and responses
- Support intent variations and synonyms for improved matching accuracy
- Develop automated testing for new intents to validate proper functionality
- Document the intent onboarding process for future maintainers

#### 2. Wiki Knowledge Base Integration
- Develop a crawler to systematically scan and index designated wiki spaces (starting with GCPDOC)
- Implement natural language processing to convert wiki content into searchable knowledge
- Create a vector database for semantic storage and retrieval of knowledge chunks
- Build a response generation system that synthesizes knowledge into direct answers
- Enable the bot to cite sources when providing information from the knowledge base
- Implement scheduled crawling to keep the knowledge base current with wiki updates

#### 3. Chat Lifecycle Analytics
- Track key metrics throughout the conversation:
  - Time to first response
  - Intent recognition success/failure rate
  - Number of fallback responses triggered
  - Chat duration and message count
  - User satisfaction indicators (explicit or implicit)
- Create a dashboard to visualize these metrics with filtering capabilities
- Implement session tagging to categorize conversations by topic, outcome, and complexity
- Set up anomaly detection for identifying problematic patterns
- Design a feedback collection mechanism for continuous improvement

### Technical Requirements:
- The solution must integrate with the existing Rasa framework and Optimus implementation
- Wiki crawler must respect authentication requirements and rate limits
- Knowledge base should support versioning to track changes over time
- Analytics must comply with data privacy regulations and anonymize user data
- All components should be containerized for deployment in the current OpenShift environment

### Success Metrics:
- Reduce time to onboard new intents by 70%
- Increase successful intent recognition rate to >90%
- Provide direct answers (without link referral) for at least 60% of queries
- Generate actionable insights from analytics within 30 days of implementation
